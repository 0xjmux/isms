AP Lang Philosophies project text based game

**You have to install Python 3 for this to work, because I wasn't able to figure out how to package this as a windows executable. Just get the most recent version of Python 3, and it should work. **

It's a text based adventure game, similar to games like Zork from the 1980s. It follows the path of a student, exploring the different philosophies throughout American history.
